ABOUT ALAN:

Alan is a transformation engine written in java and developed for an university project in Software security. 
It allows realizing several transformations to an android application.
There is a fixed chain of transformations which can be enabled or disabled by the framework checkboxes.


HOW TO...:

In order to start the engine, You must run the Main.java class, so you can see the engine GUI. 
Next, You must add a folder containing the apk files to transform, clicking the "add apk" button.
After selected desired transformations, click the "Start" button to run the engine.

After you click "Start", the engine will create two folders named "signed" and "evaluated".
In the "signed" folder ther will be the apk transformed, instead, in the "evaluated" folder, you will find the
original apk, which have been processed.
