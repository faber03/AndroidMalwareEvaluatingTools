# AndroidMalwareEvaluatingTools
In order to accomplish a deep antimalwares' detection algorithms analysis, we developed two different tools, both coded in Java.<br><br>

The first tool, named Alan, through a simple UI, provides the application of eight different smali code transformations<br> 
(detailed informations about these transformations can be found into the paper attached with the project).<br>
This tool contains other two free tools (signapk, apktool) used to decompile and recompile an android<br>
application, providing  almost original resources of the application.<br>
The tool works on smali code, a human readable dalvik bytecode.<br>
The aim of these transformations is hiding a malicious behaviour of an application from static malware scanning techniques.
A transformed application can be submitted on the website "virustotal.com" where it can be analyzed by <b>57</b> well-known (free and paid) anti-malwares.<br><br>

In order to work on a large malaware data-set, we developed a second tool, composed basically of code
enabling an automatic upload of the android applications on virus-total, using his specific java API, storing
result analysis on a relational database.This tool provides a simple UI to select among several queries, presenting results on html files<br>
Everything is well-documented and ready to be improved for future works.<br>
